Big O Cheat Sheet

O(1) - Constant time
Example: Accessing an array element by index.
Time does not depend on input size.

O(log n) - Logarithmic time
Example: Binary search.
Grows very slowly even for large inputs.

O(n) - Linear time
Example: Iterating through an array.
Time grows in direct proportion to input size.

O(n log n) - Linearithmic time
Example: Merge Sort, QuickSort (average case).
Common in efficient sorting algorithms.

O(n^2) - Quadratic time
Example: Nested loops.
Becomes slow for large inputs.

O(n^3) - Cubic time
Example: Triple nested loops.
Extremely slow for large inputs.

O(2^n) - Exponential time
Example: Recursive solutions for subsets.
Impossible to handle for big inputs.

O(n!) - Factorial time
Example: Generating all permutations.
Grows insanely fast.
